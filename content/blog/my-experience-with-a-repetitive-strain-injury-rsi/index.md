**UPDATE**: After visiting a specialist, it turns out that I have a [Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/repetitive-strain-injury-rsi/) and not Carpal Tunnel Syndrome as my Primary Care Doctor thought. So while you may see references to Carpal Tunnel below and the doctor confirmed that the changes I made to my desk setup and lifestyle were helpful, the actual diagnosis ended up being an RSI. In addition to the below, the doctor also suggested that I take vitamin B6 for a few months which seemed to greatly reduce the pain in my wrists and arms. Woot!

Well, I never expected to be writing an article like this since I feel like I've heard of the proper and ergonomically correct way to sit and work at a desk since my first typing class in highschool. But a few months ago I began to feel a slight tingling in my hands, which has recently gotten progressively worse, and last night's visit to my PCP confirmed that I have [carpal tunnel syndrome](https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/carpal-tunnel-syndrome/). Slightly mild but it's still there.

They asked me about my current desk setup and so I began to describe how I have a very minimalist approach with only my laptop and a large monitor.

How to not set up your desk unless you want to have carpal tunnel.

Both the nurse and the doctor gave me a look when I told them that I use my laptop's keyboard and tracpad exclusively. So this morning I came into work and promptly began making adjustments and researching the most ergonomic setups, stretches, and exercises for treating my affliction. Hopefully these will help you avoid a bit of pain as well.

## My tips on how to avoid getting carpal tunnel and alleviate pain if you already have it:

### **Step 1:** Take breaks often

You can set a timer on your phone or use a Chrome extension like the [Marinara: Pomodoro¬Æ Assistant](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/marinara-pomodoro%C2%AE-assist/lojgmehidjdhhbmpjfamhpkpodfcodef), which is what I‚Äôve started using. I‚Äôve used the [pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) for my workflow off and on and really like it. I think I‚Äôll actually try to be more consistent with it now and have set a timer to remind me to take a break every 25 minutes or so.

### **Step 2:** Change your desk setup

I made nearly every adjustment shown in this nifty video and can already feel a huge difference in my hands and wrists. From adjusting my arm rests, to using a separate keyboard and mouse and positioning them at the suggested distances.

### **Step 3:** Helpful stretches and exercises to prevent or alleviate pain

[This article by Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/health/carpal-tunnel-wrist-exercises) shows the three simple stretches that I've started doing which seem to alleviate the pain most. My favorite is the ‚ÄúSpider Pushups‚Äù one because you can do it anytime without getting weird looks from your coworkers üòÇ. This video also shows three other stretches that I found helpful:

### **Step 4: (Bonus)** Consider a vertical mouse

Anker

[Buy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Wireless-Vertical-Ergonomic-Optical/dp/B00BIFNTMC?SubscriptionId=AKIAIA3UEVTLIG7AIKFA&tag=thebarlen-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B00BIFNTMC)

I made the switch to an Anker vertical mouse and could feel a big difference right away. It may feel odd to hold a mouse in this way at first but my hand and wrist felt a lot more relaxed right away. I even found [a neat article](http://ergonomictrends.com/benefits-of-a-vertical-mouse-and-how-to-properly-use-one/) on the pros and cons of using a vertical mouse and even proper usage.

### Conclusion

Hopefully you‚Äôre reading this article early enough that you haven‚Äôt experienced any symptoms of carpal tunnel and can make some changes to your desk setup and workflow. If you‚Äôre already experiencing pain or tingling definitely go see a doctor as soon as possible. I‚Äôm also making an appointment with a hand specialist and will update this post with any new information or treatment suggestions I get. Cheers!
