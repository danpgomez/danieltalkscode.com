I'm thrilled to share some exciting news with you all. After months of hard work, I've launched my very own YouTube channel - [Daniel Talks Code](https://www.youtube.com/@danieltalkscode)!

My goal is to create insightful tutorials on Kotlin, Android development, and general programming concepts. From beginners to seasoned developers, everyone is invited to join the coding journey.

Check out my latest video where I talk about 5 tips that helped make my coding journey easier and  more exciting:
