One of the things I've wanted to improve on is my use of Kotlin Scope functions in my everyday workflow. And so I decided to start a short series where I'll talk about how to use each of the functions along with an example or two.

Starting with the [`.apply`](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/scope-functions.html#apply) scope function, it is useful for building objects as it applies the actions within the corresponding lambda to the object that it is called on. It doesn't return a value, but instead you get the object itself. Which means you can both declare a new object and "apply" multiple actions on it at the same time.

```kotlin

class NinjaTurtle(
    val name: String,
    val color: String,
    val weapon: String,
) {
    fun training() {
        println("$name is now a ninja!")
    }

    fun feed() {
        println("$name loves üçï!")
    }
}

fun main(args: Array) {

    val donnie = NinjaTurtle(
        "Donatello",
        "purple",
        "bo"
    ).apply {
        training()
        feed()
    }

}
```
